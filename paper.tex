%% The "author" command and its associated commands are used to define
%% the authors and their affiliations.

%% "authornote" and "authornotemark" commands
%% used to denote shared contribution to the research.

%% By default, the full list of authors will be used in the page
%% headers. Often, this list is too long, and will overlap

%% of authors' names for this purpose.

%%
%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
