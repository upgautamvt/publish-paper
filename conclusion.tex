\section{Conclusion}
This paper identifies the fundamental \gap{} within the current Linux eBPF
    infrastructure that is the source of its poor usability.
We make the observation that by using a safe language for kernel extensions and
    remove the extra verification layer, both the desired usability and safety can be
    achieved.
We demonstrate this by presenting \projname{}, a Rust-based kernel extension
    framework for the Linux kernel that leverages language-based safety from
    Rust without a separate verfier.
We show that \projname{} is able to solve existing usability issues
    associated with the eBPF verifier without performance costs, facilitating
    safe and easy-to-write kernel extensions.
