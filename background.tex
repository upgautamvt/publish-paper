\section{Background}

\subsection{eBPF}

\begin{itemize}
    \item verification
    \item helpers
    \item eBPF problems, echo the HotOS paper
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rust}

\begin{itemize}
    \item language-based safety
    \item expressiveness
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rust v.s. eBPF}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Probably has a better place
    \item Sets and examples we discussed
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Rust and eBPF: Small, simple programs
            \item eBPF but not Rust: certain code is unsafe in Rust but safe in
                eBPF, e.g. reinterpreting bytes in a packet into another struct
            \item Rust but not eBPF: Expressiveness argument
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
