\subsection{Other OS extension}
A large body of work exists around the theme of creating extensible operating systems.
Systems such as SPIN \cite{spin} utilize the type safety of Modula-3 to produce safe extensions that dynamically link into the kernel.
VINO \cite{vino} uses software fault isolation techniques and interposition to allow for kernel functions to be replaced, or event-based extensions to be implemented.
Similarly, SLIC \cite{slic} uses interposition as a mechanism to allow trusted extensions to be run with only minimal operating system changes.
